# fastai-course19-practical-deep-learning

Codes of my learning journy with the courses:
* [Fast AI 2019 (Part 1): Practical Deep Learning for Coders, v3](https://course19.fast.ai/) 
* [Fast AI 2019 (Part 2): Deep Learning from the Foundations](https://course19.fast.ai/part2)

Jeremy prefers jupyter notebooks and uses them in the courses, but as I'm used to work with Python scripts or programs I'm replicating parts of the lessons in scripts.

Just for academic purposes!
